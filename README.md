# Learning C++

This repository is my personal journey into learning C++.  
I’m starting with the very basics and building up step by step, documenting each small project along the way.  

The goal of this repo is to track my progress, practice writing C++ code, and create a reference I can look back on as I improve.

## About This Journey
- Each folder contains a small project, starting simple and gradually increasing in complexity.  
- Every project has a short write-up (`README.md`) explaining what I learnt from it.  
- This is not meant to be a polished library, it’s a record of my learning process.

## Why C++?
I chose C++ because it is:
- A powerful and widely used programming language.
- Great for understanding how computers work at a lower level.
- A solid foundation for exploring game development, systems programming, and performance-critical applications.
